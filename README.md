# git-hooks

This is just a collection of Git hook scripts I've written and used in various
projects. Take them and do as you please.

- `post-receive` - *For bare remote repository.* This script is designed to run
  on a remote host after a branch is pushed to. It will need tweaking to work
  properly.
